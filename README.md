## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14.x or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (included with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ````
   git clone https://github.com/nadel-la/yme_server.git
   ```

2. Change to the project directory:

   ````
   cd yme_server
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ````
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To start the server, run the following command in the project directory:
